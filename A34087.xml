            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Such things as theſe being weighed, I determined to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his Pretenſions in this matter, and in Order thereto caſt ſome thoughts together,

            <head>THE Introduction.</head>
            <p>THE Diviſions among Chriſtians being fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Enemy of Souls, are as Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly retorted upon the very Profeſſion, as they were vigorouſly promoted; hereby ſome are encouraged to Separation, and others hence take the Confidence to diſpute the Truth of the Religion it ſelf, becauſe of the various Sentiments of ſuch as own it. <hi>Celſus</hi> the Heathen, Objected this early; to which<note n="*" place="margin">Origen Con.

            <p>The Apoſtle having fore-told that there muſt be Sects or Hereſies; inſtead of being an Argument againſt Chriſtianity, they prove one for it; all Callings or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions have their various Rules and Methods; few Laws are made which meet not with various Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Exact Agreement ſeems more like a Deſign or Compact. It is more poſſible to be at one in the ways of Errour: And in darkneſs Men will ſtick cloſer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
            <p>Whereas the more there is of Light and Truth, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is the more concern'd againſt them; and among ſuch variour Educations, Intereſts, and Tempers, it cannot be Morally expected, but that ſome ſingular Sect-Maſters will appear, and toll in Proſelytes And though our Differences are too many at preſent, yet we can

But whilſt the ſence of ſome Texts or Articles have been Debated, the Sacred Scriptures themſelves have meet with ſevere meaſure: By ſome, their Authority and Truth have been diſputed; by others their Phraſeology and Style: One while their Language is too plain. not Courtly enough, nor ſtrewed with Rhetorical Flowers.</p>

               <hi>THomas Ellwood,</hi> in the Name of his Party, claims ſuch Communications and Heavenly Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, as good Chriſtians are not Conſcious they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor dare tempt God in deſiring. The proofs thereof he fetcheth from Scripture, wherein I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther read his Name, nor that of Quakers; but if they conclude for him, they conclude as ſtrongly for me. I profeſs my ſelf a Believer in that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who made thoſe Promiſes, and whom <hi>T.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44756:32"/> Where our Aſſent is required to any thing, God is pleaſed to afford us means for our Conviction, and is ſatisfied with ſuch a degree thereof, as the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences will carry. When matters of Fact are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, the Teſtimonies of our own or other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſences conclude us. When matters of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, thereupon uſing our beſt Faculties, ſuch a meaſure of Aſſent is ſufficient, as thoſe Reaſons will enforce. But when one tells me, He hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Divine Inſpirations, thereby I am Arreſted; for I muſt not diſpute any thing that is ſpoken by God: my onely enquiry is, whether God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo ſpoken, as is pretended.</p>
            <p>Which being a matter of great moment, God hath abundantly provided, that we ſhould not be impoſed on, by giving us both Caution and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: And the more diligent we are in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and trying ſuch Claims, the more is he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with us, and will bleſs that Induſtry, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Obedience.</p>
            <p>The Old and New Teſtament give us many warnings, about Dreamers, falſe Prophets, &amp;c. Command to beware of them; not to believe, but try them: And for matter of Security, God hath abounded in that, by furniſhing his Meſſengers with ſuch extraordinary Powers, that thereby mens belief was both Commanded and Secured,<note place="margin">

            <p>Nor did it ſeem conſiſtent with Gods Wiſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, to give Immediate Revelations, and not to furniſh the Receiver with ſuch Divine Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonials, as might truly ſatisfie him that God ſpoke, and alſo command Faith and Obedience from others.</p>
            <p>Gods immediate Voice hath not uſed to come ſo precariouſly into the World, to be miſ-pent and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44756:33"/> waſted for want of Evidence; and it might be an intangling thought to an Inſpirado, would he conſider it, why the former old Revelations ſhould not at this day be as good to convey the Doctrine and meaning of Chriſtianity as the former old Miracles were, and are ſtill ſufficient to ſettle, and ſeal its Truth; or that Miracles ſhould be ſet as Seals to confirm ſuch revealed Doctrines, and yet thoſe Doctrines in After-ages need as freſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations to convey and expound them; and in the mean time have no Miracles to atteſt the Truth of thoſe Expoſitions; eſpecially when different pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Revelations bring as different Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; theſe do more and more enſnare, but we may extricate our ſelves by allowing, as the old Miracles to be the Seals, ſo the old Revelations thereby atteſted, to be the Objects of our Faith.</p>
            <p>But when I find high Claims of renewed Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and therewith as ſtudious an undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and depreſſing the Honour of Miracles; and withal the rejecting the Scripture, from being the Rule to try the Spirits by, as Quakers do; and withal when I find ſuch Caution uſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſatisfie himſelf and others, that God ſpoke by him. None, eſpecially if their Claims be really Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, can quarrel to have them examined by ſuch means of Diſcovery, as a wiſe Religion, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Reaſon afford unto us.<note place="margin">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44756:34"/> but whilſt three different, if not contradictory Parties pretend to Infallibility, we have Reaſon to ſuſpect they are all alike Infallible. The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have a pretty Craft, but it may eaſily be ſeen thorow; The Apoſtles were endued with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Powers, both inward and outward, now they Challenge to themſelves the inward, as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Inſpiration, Infallibility, Commiſſion, Diſcerning of Spirits, the inward Baptiſm with the Holy-Ghoſt, &amp;c. which being Internal and indiſcernable may be Challenged, and are not ſo readily confuted; but then the outward, as the Miraculous deſcent of the Holy-Ghoſt, the gift of Tongues, the viſible Baptiſm with fire, the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of working Miracles of all ſorts, the Spirit of Prophecy or fore-telling future things, &amp;c. theſe being diſcernable to the ſenſe, capable of an eaſie detection; they do both deny them, and ſpeak ſlightly of their neceſſity or uſe. Though God conferred theſe outward ones as undeniable proofs and convictions of the inward; and without which ſenſible Teſtimonials, the internal would not have had that Operation, but have been like Candles under Buſhels; and this very Art lays no little prejudice upon their Plea.</p>

            <p>We may conceive ſome of them to be as the ground-work whereon he builds, the other as the Fabrick thereon raiſed. His grounds are two.</p>

            <p>God having at ſundry times and in divers manners made known his Will unto the Fathers, at the laſt in the higheſt Diſpenſation (which is never to be out dated) he ſpoke unto us by his <hi>Son</hi> (whom he hath appointed Heir of all things) that is by the God-man Chriſt Jeſus, who took our fleſh and blood, and was of the ſame nature with us: this Son of God, was God himſelf, who came to viſit the earth, and be his own Interpreter, yet ſtill he diſcharged this Office, whilſt he was Tabernacling in our <hi>Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was God with us, inſtructing us in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true Nature of man, of a Reaſonable Soul and Humane Fleſh ſubſiſting. And thus I ſuppoſe thoſe Prophecyes were fulfilled <hi>[Taught of the Lord, or Taught of God]</hi> he had the Spirit without meaſure, he was the very Temple of God, the Holy of Holyes, in and by whom the Divine Oracles were made known to Mortals.</p>
            <p>The Divine Majeſty reſided in this <hi>man Jeſus,</hi> all the former owned ways of Revelation came to attend him into the World, to uſher him into his Office, and give Credence to what he ſpoke, and yet (excepting ſome ſhort Sentences ſerving as Teſtimonials to him) they were all ſilent while he was Teaching; but ſtill <hi>Jeſus</hi> in <hi>Humane Nature</hi> took the <hi>Chair,</hi> and was Gods mouth and voice
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44756:38"/> unto mankind; as might be more fully and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly ſhewed.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles converſed with Chriſt, ſaw, heard, eat, drunk, and lived with him; how oft is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to, of their being Eye and Ear Witneſſes of what he did and ſaid? he taught them by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Parables, Conferences, explaining things privately to them, during the whole Term of his Miniſtry, and after his Reſurrection.

            <p>The Apoſtles were as certain knowing Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Chriſt, as we can be of any matters of Fact, and the Chriſtian Religion was entertained upon their Teſtimony; that they had been with, ſeen, heard and known Jeſus. God would not ſend that Religion into the World, which was to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Rule of all mankind, and command others to truſt the bringers upon their inward manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which would have expoſed, rather than have propagated Truth; but what they ſpoke they atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as matter of Fact and Knowledge, all the twelve having had perſonal converſe with Jeſus, upon whom the Holy Ghoſt viſibly deſcended, audible voices were heard, his Doctrine was delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore multitudes of Witneſſes, men were perſwaded by outward, ſenſible, even bodily evidences, and not barely left to internal ſuggeſtions, in which there may be great danger of Deluſion.</p>
            <p>And not only the Apoſtles Preached, but all the Pen-men of the New-Teſtament wrote upon their certain knowledge. S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> S. <hi>John,</hi> S. <hi>James</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Jude;</hi> had perſonal Converſation with and attendance on Chriſt, were able to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify both what they ſaw and heard, S. <hi>Luke</hi> wrote part from his own knowledge, and part from certain Information: The like Antiquitie te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyeth concerning S. <hi>Mark,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> had that want of perſonal attendance and acquaintance ſupplyed by Chriſts appearing and ſpeaking to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.14, 15. &amp; 26.16. and in many other places.<note place="margin">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44756:39"/> being a Perſecutor before, his Doctrine could not be doubtful, but commanding of our Belief; and therefore when Quakers think there may be new Inſpired Books now; That the cloſing up the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Scripture, <hi>[is a limiting God from moving or Inſpiring any men, in any Age of the World to come,</hi>

               <hi>to write any Book or Books which may be of equal Authority with the Scriptures.]</hi> They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon groſs miſtakes; for unleſs Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe on Earth again, and <hi>Ellwoods</hi> Monſtrous fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Repetition prove a real Certainty, there can be no ſuch Inſpired Books, as the new Teſtament gives us, to be written in theſe Ages; or unleſs there be another Diſpenſation, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Spirit yet to commence, which Dream is the moſt of all Deſtructive to Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Thus was Chriſtianity made known and ſettled in the World, not by Philoſophy, or Rhetorick, or any Humane Art; but by two ſuch Methods, as Heaven and Earth cannot afford greater, which S. <hi>John</hi> calls the Witneſs of men, and the Witneſs of God: the Witneſs or Teſtimony of men, is this already given; And Religion being entertained upon that Account; to tell us of new Revelations now, is a renouncing of the Faith of Chriſt, which doth command Belief not only by inward teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but outward proofs. But leſt this Witneſs of ſo many men might have been rejected, as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Deluſion or Deſign, the Witneſs of God interpoſed in ſo Publick, viſible and audible own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings both of Chriſt and his Religion, that the World was not capable of receiving more unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and convincing proofs.</p>
            <p>And further, as for the Teachings of the Spirit, which <hi>T. E.</hi> only mentions, they were of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nature from what he drives at; the ſuperve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spirit was not to evacuate or obliterate what Chriſt on Earth had ſpoken. The Teſtimony of the Apoſtles and the Spirit are conjoyned,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44756:40"/> 
               <hi>John</hi> 15.26, 27. he conferring extraordinary gifts, to engage men to believe what they delivered from their own perſonal, or certain knowledge; and where there were inward teachings, there were outward powers to teſtifie thereof to others, and ſtill the Spirit did but purſue Chriſts teachings, acted in his Name, took of his, and ſhewed it to them, opened ſuch things as they underſtood not, re-called to remembrance ſuch as they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and inſtructed in ſuch things, as before they could not bear; as about the Sabbath, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, Chriſtian Liberty, and the like. Though I think, that Chriſt in <hi>our Nature</hi> in diſcharge of his Prophetick Office, Publickly and Audibly made known all the Eſſential, Eternal Duties, or all the parts of Everlaſting Righteouſneſs. And poſſibly in ſtrict ſpeaking, that Inſpiration which the Apoſtles had, ought not to be called Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, eſpecially not in every thing. Becauſe it was conferr'd but in purſuance of what our Lord had before orally delivered in matters of Duty: for certain knowledge deſtroys not Inſpiration, nor Inſpiration certain knowledge: Nor is the uſe of former helps rejected, but taken hold of by the Spirit. Thus were the Apoſtles inſtructed, thus was our Religion ſettled, thus muſt our Saviours Prophetick Office be ſecured, and his, and the Spirits workings muſt not be confounded. And <hi>T. Ellwood</hi>'s Method of the Apoſtles coming to the knowledge of the Goſpel, is not the Method of God's making. And let it be further conſidered, if herein Satans policy do not appear, what he cannot effect by Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs: he attempts by Enthuſiaſm, under the pretence of an higher Religion, to root out the old one ſo Divinely and firmly ſettled; for the taking away the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motives to Faith, and the ſenſible grounds of Religion. And devolving the belief and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

            <p>But ſuppoſing, with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Succeſſion is ſufficient without Perſonal, we can diſcern no likeneſs between their and your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

               <hi>[They that were eye-witneſſes have delivered them unto us.]</hi> And if the difference in coming to the knowledge of the Goſpel was ſo early then, Quakers can receive like none but falſe Apoſtles now;<note place="margin">John 20.9.</note> our Lord pronounceth a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs on ſuch as have not ſeen, and yet have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: Some ſaw Chriſt, and ſome ſaw the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles who had ſeen Chriſt, &amp;c. The Doctrine of the Goſpel was tranſmitted from certain eye and ear-witneſſes, who had Divine Inſpiration al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and ſo much as God thought neceſſary for his Church, was written by thoſe Divine Pen-men,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44756:43"/> and is contained and conveyed down to us in that beſt of Books, called the Bible.</p>
            <p>But muſt the firſt ſettling a Diſpenſation be always continued? Muſt thoſe manners whereby Religion was propagated, be perpetually main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? Then Miracles are as neceſſary in the preſent Church as in the Primitive: the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments were delivered in Thundrings and Lightnings, were thoſe repeated every time the Law was read in their Synagogues and Houſes? The Holy-Ghoſt deſcended wonderfully on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi>

Religion being once ſettled by Gods extraordinary Power, needs not the daily renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Wonders; and when other Miraculous gifts are ceaſed, and Prophecy is fore-told to ceaſe as well as Tongues, and Tongues are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ceaſed: It is ſtrange, and looks like giving God the Lie, to ſay, that Prophecy is longer lived than the other. The firſt bringing in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion requires other Methods of Conviction than are neceſſary afterwards; for being entertained upon thoſe Evidences,<note place="margin">The danger of Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in an Epiſtle to the Quakers</note> and committed to writing, God continues it in a regular courſe, men inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men from theſe owned Oracles, as is well proved in a late Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George Fox</hi> upon <hi>T. Ellwood</hi>'s Principles, may quarrel with <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> that ſhe is not his Wife, becauſe not made out of his Rib, as <hi>Eve</hi> was out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s: and <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, that <hi>George Fox</hi> is not her Husband, becauſe he was not formed out of the Earth, as <hi>Adam</hi> was. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might refuſe to Plough and Sow in <hi>Canaan,</hi> expecting the ſame eaſie Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance afforded in the Wilderneſs: And we may Object, that now we are not to work, only to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44756:43"/> and <hi>wait;</hi> the Earth ought to yield us Fruit of its own accord, as it did in Paradiſe. <hi>T. E.</hi> needs the Breaſt and Spoon at forty years old as well as at four months; and all Men and Women muſt come into the World <hi>in the ſame manner</hi> with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and this is the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of holding Nature and Religion always in the Cradle.</p>
            <p>But though Quakers did not hear nor ſee Chriſt, nor have had the Spirit viſibly deſcend, yet theſe Succeſſors have the ſame <hi>inward Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> with the Apoſtles: If you prove it <hi>in the ſame manner</hi> they could, you ſhall have another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of return; till then, I ſhall be aſſured that God doth not multiply unneceſſaries, nor grant things to ſatisfie wanton Humours. Whatever Immediate Revelations the Apoſtles had, we have at this day the benefit of them in their Inſpired Writings; and God having conveyed them to us in an Intelligible Book, it is not his Method to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Revelations, to repreſent that immediately to my Soul, which he hath commanded me to read in a Book of his own Inditing. Chriſt who raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, could by the very ſame <hi>Word</hi> have rolled away the ſtone that lay over him, but he was not Prodigal of Miracles; Where other means can be uſed, Gods immediate Power will not be Arreſted. He therefore bids firſt, [<hi>Take ye away the ſtone,</hi> John 11.39. <hi>which they obeyed,</hi> v. 41.] and then he ſpeaks with Power, <hi>Lazarus, come forth.</hi> If the Apoſtles had Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelations, which I can read in my Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for me to ſay, I receive them <hi>in the ſame manner,</hi> is a Deluſion, and to deſire the receit, is a Temptation. But ſuppoſe that <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s Book was writ by Revelation, as his Hectoring Letter imports, <hi>[May the Honour be returned to that Powerful Arm, which gave both the Weapon, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44756:44"/> therewithal skill and ſtrength to uſe it:]</hi> And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Expoſitions he gives proceed from the ſame Fountain, ſtill freſh vexations do ariſe; for I am as much to ſeek how to underſtand his Book, as an Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s: If <hi>Paul</hi>'s Revelation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood without a new one, no more can <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s; the Succeſſor muſt be like the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor: and therefore till he can either write, ſo as to be underſtood, or give us ſecurity that he writes by Revelation, and withall aſſurance where to meet with another Inſpiration to capacitate us to underſtand his, Charity obligeth him to keep his ſealed-up Notions to himſelf, and not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the World with waſte Paper.</p>
            <p>But upon what grounds is all this claimed? Doth he know by Inſpiration, that all Believers receive the Goſpel as the Apoſtles did? No ſure, for he turns another way, attempts a proof thereof from Scripture-promiſes; but hereby he makes Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm a little imbodyed: 'Tis not ſo airy and ſlippery as formerly, I may now look at it, turn it about, and handle it; which leads to the third.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Proofs produced to make out this claim, and they ſeem more like the coherence of a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers dream, than the Logick of a waking Man, <hi>p.</hi> 228. Thus he takes his riſe, <hi>[As our Saviour</hi> prayed not for them onely, <hi>but</hi> all ſuch <hi>alſo</hi> as ſhould believe on him through their word. <hi>So what he promiſed concerning ſending the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter — he did not promiſe with</hi> Reſtriction <hi>and</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation <hi>onely, but with an</hi> extenſive relation to all <hi>that ſhould believe on him;]</hi> and inference that is ſtrangely wide, and deſtructive of his very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Is there no limitation becauſe he obſerves none? Nor no reſtriction implyed, where not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly given? From a Prayer for all, to infer a Promiſe to all, eſpecially when about different things, is a looſe way of Arguing. Such a Writer
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44756:44"/> may commence any thing <hi>per ſaltum;</hi> and from <hi>Fiſher</hi>'s folly inſtantly jump into the <hi>Porphyry</hi>'s Chair. Chriſt's Prayers were always granted, and his Promiſes fulfilled, but his Prayer and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe muſt not be confounded: He made Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for Tranſgreſſors; he Prayed, <hi>Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.12. Luke 23.34.</note> 
               <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, for they know not what they do.</hi> It would have been a cloſer deduction, but untrue, thence to infer, that all Tranſgreſſors, and all that know not what they do (be the Ignorance ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo culpable) are forgiven. But view the Prayer, and it confutes this perverting gloſs: it was a Prayer for all Believers <hi>[that they may be one;]</hi> that is,<note place="margin">John 17.21.</note> live in all the Duties of Chriſtian Unity. Had Chriſt prayed for Immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to all Believers in all Ages, that had been to his purpoſe, but it is not named nor concerned here. And the very words of that Prayer in <hi>v.</hi> 20. plough up his Fancy: [<hi>For them alſo who ſhall believe on me through</hi> their word,] where the Apoſtles Word, Doctrine, Preaching, and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony concerning Chriſt, is made the Motive to Mens believing in him, and Immediate Revelation is not once named.</p>
            <p>He would have alſo the promiſe of ſending the Comforter given without Reſtriction; but in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture limitations muſt be given to general words, according to matters, &amp;c. concerned.<note place="margin">Joel 2.28.</note> 
               <hi>[I will pour my Spirit upon all Fleſh.]</hi> is not upon Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Aſſes; no, nor the unconverted <hi>Indians.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 14.26.</note> [<hi>He ſhall teach you all things]</hi> is not giving the skill of Aſtronomy or Algebra: So the promiſe of the Spirit is not onely to be underſtood with Reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the very Limitations are given, <hi>John</hi> 15.27. <hi>[Ye have been with me from the beginning,]</hi> that limits it to the Perſons of the Apoſtles, who accompanyed with Chriſt, beginning from the Baptiſm of <hi>John, Acts</hi> 1.22. Hereupon Chriſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44756:45"/> ſaith, <hi>[Ye alſo ſhall bear Witneſs,]</hi> which none could do upon their certain knowledge but his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Attendants. And <hi>John</hi> 16.13. <hi>[He will ſhew you things to come,]</hi> reſtrains it alſo to the Apoſtles, which clauſe <hi>T. E.</hi> as too tough for him, ungodlily leaves out.</p>
            <p>But to Argue upon their Principles, what is <hi>Ellwood</hi> concerned in Chriſt's Promiſe made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death? when as he ſlights <hi>Luke</hi> 14.8. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſpoken [<hi>before the one Offering was Actually offered up,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Edw. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs. p. <hi>47.</hi>
               </note> p. 37.] Another ſaith, <hi>[A Command to one binds not another;]</hi> no more ſhould a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to one benefit another. [<hi>The gift of Tongues and working Miracles were peculiar to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Times,</hi>

                  <hi>Geo. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</note>] and ſo was Inſpiration alſo. Thoſe Promiſes Chriſt made juſt before his Death, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcharged his Prophetick Office, he betook himſelf to his Prieſtly; the Multitude being gone, he addreſſed himſelf in his Sermon to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, whom he left his Commiſſioners on Earth; and having finiſhed his Prayer, was preſently Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. Now, to enlarge to all Believers, what was ſpoke to that ſelect Company, will make wild Divinity: <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> ſo may paſs for <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Didymus,</hi> and challenge one of the twelve Thrones whereon to ſit and Judge the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe he inferred truly in an extenſive Relation <hi>to all Believers,</hi> till he prove me to be no Believer, he hath argued me to have Inſpiration as well as himſelf; and withal Faith being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal inviſible Grace, without another Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Revelation, I cannot be aſſured who is this true Believer, nor who hath the Spirit.</p>
            <p>It may ſuffice humble Souls that thoſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may extend in ſome ſort to the whole Church diffuſive; not to every ſingle Man, no, nor Sect of Men; nor to any Church of one Denomination
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44756:45"/> whatſoever; and that God will beſtow the Spirit of Illumination and Sanctification upon ſincere Chriſtians. But that thoſe are different from the Apoſtolical Inſpiration, without which a man may be ſaved, and with which he may be damned.</p>
            <p>To theſe he adds Auxiliary Proofs, as <hi>John</hi> 17.37, 38, 39. <hi>p.</hi> 128. in which neither Repeated nor Immediate Revelation, as perpetual, is named: And he reads it differently from his Maſter <hi>Fox,</hi> who thus turns it, <hi>[Out of whoſe Belly,</hi>

            <p>UPON theſe tottering Pillars he raiſeth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral and different Notions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To begin with their Youngeſt, that which is their Fondling, <hi>viz.</hi> the Claim of Renewed and Repeated Revelations, which (without offering one Text in favour thereof) he thus wordeth; [p. 238. <hi>Not new Revelations, that is,</hi> new things Revealed, <hi>but rather</hi> renewed Revelations, <hi>that is, Old things revealed anew: The</hi> ſame <hi>Goſpel, the</hi> ſame <hi>way of Salvation, the</hi> ſame <hi>Eſſentials of Religion, the</hi> ſame <hi>Principles and Doctrines: in a word, the ſame good Old Truths which were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the Saints of Old, and are Recorded in the Holy Scriptures,</hi> Revealed now anew.] This he is large upon, <hi>p.</hi> 243. That they are again Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the ſame Spirit, which he calls a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the former Revelations, <hi>p.</hi> 254, &amp; 256.</p>
            <p>But why names he not the Author of this knack? That would have looked untowardly upon the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediateneſs</hi> of it.<note place="margin">Im.

            <p>But though he taketh the Words and Notions of <hi>Keith,</hi> the Revelation is ſtill Immediate; for their Inſtitutor hath prettily determined. <hi>[If you would hear,</hi>

               <hi>then acquaint your ſelves with ſuch, as can ſpeak from a Teſtimony within; for as they Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what they have from the pure teachings of the Father: ſo this ſecond hand teaching will be a pure Teaching unto you, but be ſure you do not prefer this ſecond Teaching before the firſt, for now the Everlaſting Word and Goſpel muſt reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to you, or elſe you cannot be ſatisfyed:]</hi> Their own or others is firſt and ſecond hand teaching; but inſtructing from the Scriptures is not ſo much as third hand Teaching, and the Scriptures are now out of date. <hi>[The Writings of the Apoſtles — are to ceaſe,</hi>

               <hi>not being contained in the Scriptures:]</hi> the Repetition thereof if true, yet would be ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but in regard this fancy hath been conſidered by none, I know of, I ſhall a while view it, as that which makes the confuſedſt work in Prophecyes, Hiſtoryes, and all the parts of Chriſtianity: In brief, it revives the Miniſtry of Angels, as the Conveyers of Gods Will in the Chriſtian State, it ſets up <hi>Moſes</hi> to be a Teacher, reinforceth Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the Tabernacle, the Jewiſh Common-Wealth, and the Law of Sacrifices; it raiſeth up Multitudes of Perſons out of their Graves where they have reſted ſome thouſand years; it ſets up the Kingdoms of <hi>Egypt, Aſſyria, Syria,</hi> and the reſt that bordered on the Holy-Land: it muſters a great part of the World together, Kings and Kingdoms to come and ſtand before him; it lays aſide Chriſtianity, deſtroys the Motives of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, making ſuch a Miſcellaneous hotch-potch of Religion, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> did not hit on; it makes the whole Scripture Scenical, a Theatrical thing, that like a Puppet-play goes round, is renewed, repeated, in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> acted over before him.</p>
            <p>The Portentouſneſs of this <hi>chimaera</hi> will appear by looking on its Aſpect upon the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44756:49"/> wherein we may conſider Hiſtoryes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyes and other mixt matters, and diſcover whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be capable of Repetition. For Hiſtory, hath God renewed to <hi>T. E.</hi> that Command of putting off his ſhoes from off his feet? which was enjoyned to, and done by <hi>Moſes;</hi> have the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, Thunderings, Voices, which were at the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Law been heard by him? can God ſpeak to him from between the Cherubims and from the Door of the Tabernacle which are not now in being? hath he received with <hi>David,</hi> Anſwers from the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim?</hi> or need he ſome outward light from the Breaſt-Plate, who hath ſuch a Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? have the Angels Revealed thoſe Meſſages to him, which they did to <hi>Abraham, Lot</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? then <hi>Sodom</hi> was but fired the other day, or things are burnt in <hi>Effigie</hi> before him. Have the Voices to <hi>Samuel</hi> been rehearſed to him? or that to <hi>Elijah.</hi> 1 King. 19.15? then <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Hazael</hi> are now alive, and <hi>T. E.</hi> is an anointer to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>The like might be ſhewed of all Scripture-Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, that this Dream deſtroys or confounds and intangles the Truth of all. For Hiſtory relateth things done, Repetition looks on them as undone, and in doing; confounds times paſt, preſent and future: diſorders and mixeth both Perſons and Matters, and by making nothing diſtinct, leaves nothing true. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> came to <hi>Jeſus</hi> by night, <hi>Thomas</hi> put his hand into Chriſts ſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If theſe (which we know from Scripture) be repeated, then thoſe perſons muſt be now alive, if they be not repeated, they are not underſtood. Is it not enough to have all theſe recorded in a Divine Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory for our Admonition and Example? but theſe old Revelations muſt be new Revealed, and Acted over to gratify a moroſe Illuminado.</p>
            <p>This fancy doth as much diſſervice to the Truth,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44756:50"/> and certainty of Prophecyes, hath <hi>T. E.</hi> laid 390 days upon one ſide in a Viſionary Siege againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> gone to the River <hi>Chebar,</hi> beheld the draughts of a moſt glorious Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with <hi>Ezekiel?</hi> or hath he had the Revelation of St. <hi>John</hi> repeated before him Viſion after Viſion? This Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perviſor general need but move a pin, and all the Prophecyes preſent themſelves before him. I have ſeen ſome Printed papers joyned at the end of a Quakers Bible, containing the Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> the life of <hi>Paul,</hi> a Catalogue of ſeveral Scriptures which are mentioned, but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the Bible, as the Prophecy of <hi>Enoch, cum multis aliis;</hi> ſeveral Scriptures corrupted by the Tranſlators; moſt of which are where <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <hi>the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt — ſignifyed to his Servant</hi> John] to annex ſuch like claims as this [<hi>which Viſions or Revelations begun to be renewed and repeated to the Quakers in</hi> England <hi>(who are the Church returned out of the Wilderneſs) in the year</hi> 1648.] Can <hi>T. E.</hi> have had the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> reacted, as that St. of old had? then dead <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> is now afoot, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> weilds his Scepter, the 70 weeks are never begun, nor never ended, the Meſſiah muſt be uncut off, each time this Viſion is renewed: but as a Maſs-Prieſt dayly kills and butchers Chriſt, who yet
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44756:50"/> lives for all that Cruelty, ſo this renewing makes all things Scenical in Prophecy, but proves and ſettles nothing.</p>
            <p>The Prophets name their Parents, Places, with ſuch Circumſtances, owning it as a Viſion made to themſelves. <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, the Pſalms are diſtinctly named; this day, ſaith Chriſt, this Scripture is fulfilled, but not any Indication that thoſe Prophecyes could be renewed; it cannot be proved that one Prophet had the Viſions of another Prophet repeated to him, no nor that the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſame exact Viſion twice; ſo little is it probable that a thouſand can have the ſame for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver renewed downwards. This pretence in the Iſſue deſtroyeth Chriſtianity; for ſuppoſe that <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.23. <hi>(a Virgin ſhall be with Child,)</hi> be renewed, then Jeſus is not yet born, when a Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is fulfilled 'tis Impoſſible to have another: that it ſhall be fulfilled; or to deſire one to inform that it is fulfilled, is a like folly. It is equally as reaſonable to expect a Revelation that there was a K. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. as that Jeſus died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for it makes Prophecy to have no fixed, determinate, ſence, or completion. Suppoſe the <hi>Revelations</hi> be repeated, then no part of them is yet fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for what hath been done, cannot be ſcened, or ſtaged as undone: and further it renders the Scriptures uſeleſs, for what need I buy a ſealed Book not to be underſtood, when I have it line by line inwardly rehearſed by a ſupervening power to my own Spirit. Repetition alſo would ſwallow up that Bleſſed Grace of Faith, the believing things credible as credible, and turn it into ſenſe and Viſion, ſo that the deſiring it (if poſſible) is either the Mother or Daughter of Infidelity. There being alſo in tract of time ſome few <hi>Variae lectiones</hi> crept into the Sacred Volume. <hi>T. E</hi>'s Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (if right) will make a ſtand at the wrong ones

            <p>There are many particular Revelations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning places, as <hi>Nineveh, Tyre,</hi> &amp;c. Perſons, as King <hi>Ahaz, Zedechiah,</hi> &amp;c.

Only theſe few things ſhall conclude it.</p>
            <p>That if he ſpeak Truth he muſt have received all the Revelations conferred to the Saints of Old, before and after the Flood; thoſe written in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the unrecorded ones; or, if only thoſe in the New Teſtament, then thoſe of Chriſt, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, particularly S. <hi>John,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the 70 Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and thoſe mentioned in the 1 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 14. that which was the Work of many Ages, Periods and Perſons, is in a trice Acted before him, which if it was really done, I verily think he could not live; The Divine Light was ſo ſtrong in a Prophets Soul, that he could not long continue under it, but fell into Conſternations, or his Viſion declined in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44756:51"/> a Dream, all the Scripture Revelations (if the thing was poſſible) yet for length of time cannot be renewed to him ſince his turning Quaker in 1659. He muſt have time to recruit his Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Viſion and Viſion, allow Liberty for other intervening Affairs, converſe ſometimes as a man, and not always as a Prophet. And Prophecyes in their preparatoryes and effects, in their ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and dreſs, are not ſo ſoon gone thorow. <hi>Hoſea</hi> was ſome 70 years a Prophet, and yet hath but left ſome 14 little Chapters. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was 45 years between the 6th and 36th Chapters, which allows a year and a half to each Chapter. Let <hi>Ellwood</hi> Study ſuch things as theſe, and the Nature of the Prophetick light, it will make his Spirit be humble and modeſt, and will Convince him that his Hairs will be gray, before he ſee to the far end of the Revelations.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly he foreſaw not the Monſters he was hatching; let us turn the Notion into what other more favourable ſhapes we can; as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, what was Revealed by ſeveral ways before, is now renewed to him <hi>by the Spirit;</hi> This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, muſt the Holy Spirit repeat what was ſpoke by Angels, Urim, Signs, Voices, Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Dreams, Prophets?

But the Spirit now renews to him thoſe Expoſitions which he made to others, this he cannot mean, for thoſe Expoſitions are not in Scripture, and his are but the Repetition of what is therein Recorded: Withal he ſuppoſeth the Spirit to turn Expoſitor of the Sacred Text, but doth not prove it, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture Revelations, he ſhould uſe the Word in the proper Senſe, for the Subject matter by God Revealed, and not foyſt in an uncouth No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own, That Revelation is Expoſition, turning the Spirit into a Gloſſary.

            <p>'Tis ſtrange to ſee men who are Wiſe in the World, to be ſo Fancyfull in Religion, to Intitle God to the Riſings and Bublings of their own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, they ſhut up thoſe Reaſonable Souls which God gave them, as Spirits in Priſon. <hi>Anima ſuilla pro ſale,</hi> a Swines Soul ſerves for Salt, and a Quakers doth no more, juſt keeps his Body from Corruption. How low and cheap is Inſpiration made, when the Holy Spirit muſt be Imployed in Inviting men to Dinner, and they muſt be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on by Wires and Pullyes, and not proceed by Humane meaſures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T. E.</hi> hath ſuch Immediate teachings as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had, ask a Proof thereof, the return is; They Witneſs it: but they will not ſwear it: and I
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44756:53"/> think it unreaſonable to believe them on eaſier terms than our Lord himſelf was believed upon. But whilſt good Men are baffling Atheiſm with the rational grounds of Chriſtianity, Satan tacks about, and would baffle Chriſtianity by Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures.</p>
            <p>Is Inſpiration grown ſo common, that every one muſt have it? Or is God ſo Prodigal of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to exceed his regular Diſpenſations? St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who healed the Sick, exerted not that Power on Believing <hi>Timothy, Trophimus,</hi> and <hi>Epaphroditus.</hi> Chriſt increaſed the Loaves, and yet commanded the fragments to be gathered up. <hi>Hebron</hi> was promiſed unto <hi>Caleb</hi> for an Inheritance, God could have ordered the Lot to fall upon it, and yet it was ſettled by vertue of the Promiſe: Where things can be had in an ordinary way, it is not Gods Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to exceed, nor heap Miracle upon Miracle; his works are perfect, and immediate anſwers were never common: the Lot muſt not paſs upon that which was promiſed before, that would have been irreligion, or a Tempting God.</p>
            <p>There are no need of Teachers or Scriptures, if all receive immediate Inſtructions. The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents were too curious in their eſteem of the Bible, and the <hi>Traditores</hi> had too harſh Meaſure. Though all Bibles were burnt, a Quakers Light could, <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim,</hi> write a new one, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> gave <hi>Baruch</hi> the ſame words a ſecond time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, one Prophet who hath the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of another Prophet is true. I can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern no ſuch atteſtation among them, as S. <hi>John</hi> gave to Jeſus; but they firſt make themſelves Prophets, and then give Honour one to another. Till they produce ſome undoubted Evidence, I am guilty of no ſin in denying: I muſt either ſee ſome Miracles, or have an Immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion my ſelf, to aſſure me that each of them hath
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44756:54"/> ſuch and ſuch Inſpirations; and it being difficult to diſtinguiſh between the Dictates of ſpirits, and the Fancies and Motions of a Mans own upper and lower Soul. Quakers will need a ſecond Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to aſcertain them of the firſt, and a third to aſcertain them of a ſecond, and ſo forward; which is like the dancing of Fairies, a skipping and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning round, but an advancing nothing: And they are got into ſuch a Circle, wherein they may run themſelves blind. They believe the Scriptures from their Inſpirations, and thoſe again from the Scriptures, making one to prove another. The Spirit aſcertains them it is Gods Word, and from thence <hi>T. E.</hi> attempts to prove they have the Spirit.</p>
            <p>In that Debate at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 15. it was not the Immediate Inſpiration which was the Rule, which certainly would, if every one had been ſo fitted, but it was the Epiſtle from the Council that concluded all. Set up this Notion, and there would be none to be Ruled, nor any ſuch thing known as Obedience either in Church or State; for Immediate Inſtruction muſt not be control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by any thing below it ſelf, nor is it reaſonable the Divine Voice ſhould be preſcribed to. So that this pretence hath an evil aſpect upon King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which have been frequently diſturbed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Admit <hi>T.

            <p>They ſeem alſo too Covetous in their Claims, the Light and Inſpiration are too much for one Perſon; he that carries that <hi>

Thus among Pagans and others, when Viſions and Revelations have run higheſt, Reaſon hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by them; but 'tis the more plauſible way, to be intimate with God, looks better than to ſearch and prove: to wait and tamely believe what ſtarts up firſt, is more eaſie than to weigh, diſcourſe, and judge aright; but when Men grow Credulous and ſlothful, departing from ſober Reaſon, and known Rules, preſently they ſtrike in with Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Suggeſtions: and it is a moſt guſtful Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to adore the Creatures of their own Fancy. But while they, with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> dare enſhrine Apes, and Worſhip ſuch Counterfeits as Satan or their Souls afford, ſober Chriſtians will adhere to a ſound Mind, and a diſcerning Spirit, conducted by owned and certain Revelations,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Cauſabon Enthuſ.</hi> 170.</note> thinking that <hi>[Rational, intellectual Chriſtian Knowledge is above all Prophecy.]</hi>

            <p>But from them let us look into the Chriſtian World, where we ſhall find Satan turned his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Rival, countermining God with Revelations, gulling all Ages of the Church with Enthuſiaſts, and imitating Miracles with his lying Wonders; for Enthuſiaſm is Satans Engine, renewed often by him, called in to untie a knot, to make good an otherwiſe indefenſible Paſs, and to ſupply the want of better Arguments, Revelations being as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with them as Reaſons are with other Men.</p>

            <p>The pretenders to Inſpiration are many, I ſhall ſingle out ſome in theſe ſeveral Periods. In the Primitive Church, in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, at the time of the Reformation, and in the late unhappy T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Here are Competitours ſufficient, that agree in one bottom, though they build different and contradictory Doctrines upon it; and all theſe (likely an hundred to one; and in this very King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of late ten to one) being the far greater number are all againſt the Quakers: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſe the Scripture did not pleaſe me, which of theſe Pretenders muſt I give Credit to? The others whether old or late produce as good Proofs as <hi>T. E.</hi> can do; and if I favour one ſide where the Evidences are equal, I become partial, and hold the Faith with Reſpect of Perſons. Do the Quakers ſay and witneſs their Inſpirations? The others do the like with an equal confidence. Do they Experience it? The reſt come not behind them. If their Refreſhings perſwade? the <hi>Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> and the late named Whore can uſe the ſame Topick, and the Ranter is as brisk as any. If
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44756:70"/> ſome Scriptures befriend their Fancy? the reſt, and all Hereticks, and the Devil himſelf, do bait their Hooks with wreſted parcels of it. In caſe then of different Revelations, to which muſt I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here? Or ſhall I not ſuſpend, untill a third Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation do determine which ſide is in the right? Muſt we believe men meerly becauſe they ſay ſo? Or are yea, yea, and a few Solemn looks, or wrings by the hand Evidences that the Spirit is ſecretly whiſpering? They lay no Obligation on us to truſt them, rather than their Rivals. In their Words, Lives and Writings they ſeem at leaſt Fallible, like other men. <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> muſt then produce better Evidences than the reſt; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we are Innocent. And he hath cut him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out work ſufficient. 1. To prove that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Inſpiration is certainly promiſed by God to all Believers. 2. He muſt prove that all other pretenders do ly, in their claims. 3. That ſuch as deny Immediate Revelation have no ſhare thereof. 4. He muſt by ſome undoubted Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences prove that his party are ſolely intruſted with this Miniſtration, and when this is done, he muſt leave to us the power of Tryal, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Judgment. For if each muſt follow the Light, we are Innocent who do but follow our own Convictions; and our caſe is infinitely more ſafe: for all partyes agree that the Light of Scriptures (by which we are guided) is Divine, but your new Light may prove falſe, or Darkneſs, for any aſſurance you can yet give us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>There are all theſe Co-claimers, who both ſay and ſhew as much as Quakers, and ſo each ſingle party are an equal ballance to them, much more all of them together do ſtrangely out-weigh the Quakers next to youngeſt claims (unleſs the Rule be now inverted <hi>verum quodcunque prius,</hi> and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44756:71"/> what is lateſt muſt neceſſarily be trueſt) which could only hold until a freſher Sect (ſuppoſe the <hi>ſweet Singers of Iſrael,</hi> or any ſuch pretty name) do ſtart up and out-date the Quakers, but though all the other Competitors were in the wrong, that doth not infer <hi>T.

            <p>Did not Chriſt ſpeak Intelligibly to ſuch as heard him? have not the Apoſtles plainly and faithfully ſet down his words? or, though he had ſpoke darkly, yet the Spirits deſcent made things clearer, ſo that the darkneſs cannot yet continue. We ſhall find ſome, and thoſe no belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who underſtood Chriſts words ſo as to leave them without Excuſe. <hi>Pilate,</hi> the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, Scribes, Sadduces, Officers, with the other Jews, though no Diſciples, underſtood his Language: Their ſin is heightned, not from want of knowing what he ſpoke; but non-Entertainment of what was ſo convincing.</p>

               <hi>Judas</hi> his Sin was heinous, and yet the Holy Ghoſt was not then given. This Notion draws a ſtrange cloud over Gods Proceedings, making all ſins alike, except in the degree of the Revelation: for where that is not, there being no knowledge there can be no ſin; and where Immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is, it makes each ſin to be the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Whatever Ignorance we have in Scriptures, upon <hi>Thomas Ellwood's</hi> Principle, is ſolely Imputable to the Spirit not moving. Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting makes us Innocent, God cannot damn any but
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44756:90"/> ſuch as have Immediate Inſpirations, and to hear and not underſtand, though taken for a ſin, yet is not ſo much as a puniſhment by this mans Divinity; ſo that a Quaker need not go to the Temple or Altar, but Cripple like to <hi>wait</hi> for the moving of the waters.

            <p>Laws are penned in an Intelligible ſtyle, elſe they are ſnares, and men know not when to yield Obedience, and the Scriptures were taken for a Law. The Apoſtle is for an underſtood Language in Church-aſſemblies; much more then in the Divine Oracles, which are Deſigned for the Generality, Ignorant as well as Learned, and ſo can have no crafty, concealed or reſerved Sence in them: The matters of Neceſſary Duty and Faith may be ſoon known, and the Spirit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to love, Practiſe and believe them; and in the more Difficult things he ſo Bleſſeth the means, that we ſhall either know them or be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; it is not neceſſary to Salvation to be able to Explain each Verſe in Scripture; a man may have the true Spirit of God, and yet not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Apocalypſe exactly. God Requires Holy Living more than Accurate Interpreting, and an honeſt heart at the laſt day, will go further than either a Critical or an Inſpired head. Quakers alſo ſhould not urge that Scripture to us which they deny to be <hi>the Rule;</hi> But <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi>'s manner of Proving is ſtrangely wild: he affirmeth Scripture cannot be underſtood without Inſpiration, and to prove it, produceth Scripture, which cannot be underſtood without that Inſpiration, which we deny we have. Are thoſe Texts ſo plain that they prove it in our way? or doth Inſpiration light on thoſe who Diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44756:91"/> againſt it? Except it can be underſtood without Inſpiration, he ſhould not Produce it to thoſe who deny it, for the proof of it; and as long as the manner of Interpreting Scripture is under Debate, they ſhould not produce one Text of it, till that debate be ended: but his Proving from it, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it plain and full for that purpoſe, and is the direct confutation of his own notion. Nor have Quakers ſhewed ſo much gratitude for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Diſcoveries, that God ſhould diſcover more unto them.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44756:91"/> Propoſals; and God who Commands us not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every Spirit, but try them will never damn me for ſearching and Examining what is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to come from him. He that Injoyns us to ſearch his own Revelations, will not be diſpleaſed if we uſe the ſevereſt Caution about others; he who queſtions, muſt needs be in a ſafer ſtate than he who eaſily believes, and he that compares and weighs will be freer from Errour than he who waits and Entertaines the firſt comer.</p>
            <p>Their two Principles of Chriſt, the Light and Immediate Teaching, are either Inconſiſtent, or the one is ſuperfluous; for in making but one <hi>Eſſential,</hi> they Invalidate one of their <hi>two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> How do they underſtand their great Text. <hi>John.</hi> 1.9. that Chriſt is a ſaving Light in every man? if by Immediate Revelation, then the light doth not diſcover all things, but needs another to diſcover it ſelf? if the Light Interpret it in Reference to it ſelf, as moſt Properly it ſhould, <hi>[all Power in Heaven and Earth being given unto it.]</hi> Then ſomething is known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Inſpiration Immediate?

If any Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then did ſuddenly become an Inſpired Chriſtian, this might befriend them, but their Engliſh'd <hi>Hai Ebr Yokdan</hi> was not ſo.

            <p>I cannot diſcover how I can underſtand the Quakers Books, for though they ſeem to uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, ſo that I may conſult my Reaſon, yet they being uſually writ <hi>[from the Spirit of the Lord,]</hi> I need an Inſpiration to underſtand them, as much as any Verſe in the Bible, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to aſcertain them to be Divine, and ſo all the former difficulties recur: a Papiſt is much more modeſt, for though he make his Church, or its Head, Infallible, yet he will confeſs his ſingle ſelf Fallible; and Infallible claims needing Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Evidences, we can never be certain of your

            <p>Truth loves calmneſs, and the ſtill voyce, Lo here, or there is Chriſt, are not its Watch-word, modeſt demands go furtheſt, when backed with ſtrong Proofs. I have the Liberty to try and judge rational Expoſitions, whereas your Inſpired ones impoſe upon me, but the Deſign is crafty, it is a kind of Sacriledge to Diſpute that which ſaith, It comes from God: So that this pretence inſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them, rendring thoſe moving Oracles Sacred and Venerable; and, 'Tis better to buy their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Living Teſtimonies, than a dark Lettered Bible.

            <p n="2">2. If Miracles were neceſſary when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were Writ, which are a dead Letter, a Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Book and worſe; then are they much more neceſſary, when Inſpired Expoſitions thereof are given: To allude to <hi>T. Ellwoods</hi> terms of ſhell and kernel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God would not give a Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſhell was his, and leave us at a loſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the kernel was his alſo, if he ſend Evidences along with the bark, rind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he would do the ſame much more with the Subſtance. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy continuing 1548 years, we need ſigns, that this is the ſame Doctrine with the old, eſpecially if the Scripture, the Repoſitory of that Doctrine
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44756:97"/> cannot be underſtood without Inſpiration; there being many Pretenders, we need a Sign, more at the unſealing than at the ſealing of that Book: if to receive the Letter, much more to underſtand the Spirit, the ſence when given as from God, needs moſt of all his Atteſtation to it, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to give an Inſpired Expoſition of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is more than the bringing new Scriptures, and needs greater Atteſtations, as much as the ſenſe is better than the Letter. And <hi>Thomas Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> knows not what he hath, but if he have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations they muſt be new ones, for Revelation being neceſſary to underſtand the Scriptures; thoſe Expoſitions <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> receives muſt be new, the Repetition is the reacting the old, but then the Expounding is the conferring new, which are not to be found within the Bible.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The debate being whether or no they be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, upon their grounds, nothing can end it, but the interpoſing of Gods Power: For to ſay, They Witneſs it is a begging the Queſtion, and to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit thoſe Witneſſings will expoſe to deluſions, to produce Scripture diſowned by them as the Rule, is improper, and concludes nothing; being it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood without Inſpiration when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; or if it could, ſtill it concludes as equally for any other Pretender as for them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He who abrogates a Divine Law, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce greater Authority for ſo doing, than that by which at firſt it was inſtituted. Thus Chriſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king down or altering that way of Worſhip which had been ſet up by a Power of Miracles in <hi>Moſes,</hi> produced greater Evidences than <hi>Moſes</hi> that he was ſent from God. And that Quakers do abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Chriſts Commands, is evident from ſlighting his Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Shewen</hi> concerning Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the Diſciples and Apoſtles having Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſome, proceeds <hi>[not diſcerning the times

            <p n="6">VI. <hi>THomas Ellwood</hi> is the Succeſſour of the Primitive Chriſtians, as well as of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and he informs that [<hi>the Primitive Chriſtians did receive the knowledge of the Goſpel, from the Immediate Teachings of the Holy Spirit,</hi> p. 233. <hi>to the like purpoſe</hi> p. 245.] which he enlargeth from the Primitive Chriſtians [<hi>to have been in all ages Revealed to the Saints in ſome Degree or other,</hi> p. 237.] This is matter of Fact, and the Truth of it Depends upon Proof from Hiſtory: not one word thereof is produced, and the former Inſtances about St. <hi>Baſil, Nazianzene,</hi> &amp;c. do not encourage us to truſt either his Learning or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. We are now upon the Negative, and it belongs to him to prove out of undoubted Hiſtories that the Goſpel came to be known in all Ages by Immediate Revelation: we find the Fathers very learned, and coming thereto by Study, and uſing ſuch means of expounding as Proteſtants do. We find their Expoſitions differing both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and from the Quakers; let <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> ſhew which Fathers were Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which of their Works were writ by it, how we muſt underſtand thoſe Inſpired Expoſitions
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44756:102"/> of theirs; for they ſeem likelier to have Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation than any in this Age;<note place="margin">In Epiſt. ad Paulin.</note> St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> makes that Prophecy of <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.28. ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled <hi>[ſuper</hi> 120 <hi>credentium nomina, &amp; effuſum iri in caenaculo Syon.]</hi> upon thoſe 120 Names in <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and at the deſcent upon the Apoſtles <hi>Act.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">

            <p>The Pretence to Revelation was all along diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned in the true Church after the ſettlement of Chriſtianity.<note place="margin">Cont. Haereſ 48.</note> 
               <hi>Epiphanius</hi> condemns the <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> for bringing in new Prophets, <hi>poſt terminum Propheticorum donorum,</hi> after the Expiration of Prophetical Gifts, and ſaith, They bring <hi>alios pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetas poſt prophetas,</hi> would introduce a new brood or Series of them.</p>

               </gap>, this was urged by <hi>Miltiades</hi> in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> adding to them <hi>Ammias</hi> of <hi>Phyladelphia</hi> and <hi>Quadratus:</hi> and that if the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Prophecy after the Prophets, others by the like rule may challenge it after the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> and ſo <hi>in infinitum.</hi> We are certain that the Extraordinary Viſible gifts are ceaſed, and thence we infer that the Inviſibles bore at moſt but an equal date with them, and that Miracles conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued longer in the Church than Immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration is apparent in that we find footſteps of the one, after the other was diſowned, and the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44756:103"/> Divine will might ſoon be made known, whereas the continuance of its Teſtimonials in the World ſome while after was more neceſſary. <hi>Tertullian</hi> called his by the name of <hi>Nova Prophetia, New Prophecy:</hi> an Evidence that the old was ceaſed, and how he was diſowned by the Church is Notorious.</p>
            <p>Though there were many ſucceeding Prophets under the Law, that doth not infer it muſt be ſo under the Goſpel, for thoſe Prophets brought in Light by degrees, and prepared the way for Chriſt: but then Prophecy lay Silent for about 400 years before his appearing, a ſign that he came to fulfil and Seal up all, and when God himſelf took the chair, and in our nature diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his Office, it faſtens Imperfection on him, to maintain a Series of Prophets, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what he ſpoke, or relate what he omitted. The new Teſtament foretells of falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but no where promiſeth a ſucceſſion of new ones. Nor is it poſſible, Chriſtianity being entertained upon their Perſonal knowledge of Chriſt, and the Viſible Evidences of the Spirit; which alſo inwardly inclined men to ſearch into, to approve and choſe what the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly propoſed, and now Learning and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſupply to us what the Spirit Immediately vouchſafed to them,<note place="margin">In Epiſtle ad Paulinuim.</note> as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith <hi>[quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid enim aliis exercitatio &amp; quotidiana in lege meditatio tribuere ſolet, iſtis hoc Spiritus ſanctus ſuggerebat.]</hi>

               <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> makes ſome attempts of proof about the Reformation, as from <hi>Tindal. p.</hi> 273 but neither renewed, Immediate nor Expoſitory Revelations are therein owned nor doth it concern Notional (about which our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44756:103"/> is) but Practical knowledge, he deals very unfaithfully with Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> who proves from the Antients, That many things are eaſy in the Scripture, <hi>p.</hi> 393. and he ſtrikes in with <hi>Harding</hi> about the darkneſs of Scriptures, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them, not by reading, but by ſpecial Revelation and Miracle. <hi>p.</hi> 394. And that which the Biſhop calls Help and Prompting. <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> transforms into Inſpiration and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Divine Spirit. <hi>p.</hi> 275.

               <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> That <hi>Thomas Ellwoods</hi> ways of Expounding do destroy the Scripture.</head>
            <p>OUR Author having repreſented the Bible dark, to prepare the way for his ſuppletory Spirit, as if this affront was not ſufficient, he doth diſperſedly inſinuate ſeveral things, which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect do diſcharge all, or moſt of the written word.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He declines what is urged from the Law, ſaying, <hi>p.</hi> 134. [<hi>that it was to them of Old time under the Law (which was a State of weakneſs and Childhood, and ſo of Contention and Strife,)</hi> &amp;c.] whereas Chriſt propoſeth Childhood as freeſt from Contention, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.35. and thus the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtiſts, called <hi>Concionatores,</hi> looked upon the Old Teſtament as abrogated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He makes nothing of Chriſts Example in Preaching upon a Text, <hi>Luc.</hi> 4.17. by this Art, <hi>p.</hi> 200. <hi>[that it was in the time of the Law, and ſuitable to that Miniſtration, when reading and expounding the Law and the Prophets was a part of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Service, but it is not a ſufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for the like practice in the time of the Goſpel.]</hi> a Rule that enervates Chriſts Example and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, becauſe done and ſpoke before the Law was antiquated.</p>
            <p>He makes nothing of what Chriſt ſpoke to the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44756:109"/> Phariſees <hi>[that about chuſing the loweſt room,</hi> Luke 14.8. <hi>was ſpoke to the Phariſees, who had an itch to take place,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but</hi> p. 41. <hi>what was it to Chriſts own Diſciples? did he ever Inſtruct them after this manner? no ſuch matter.]</hi> by which he diſobligeth Chriſtians from any Obedience to what Chriſt ſpoke to ſuch as were not his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and ſo demoliſhes a good part of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Being preſſed from <hi>Luc.</hi> 14.8. that there ought to be diſtinctions of Perſons, he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 41. <hi>[thoſe words were not ſpoken with Relation to the times of the Goſpel, nor directed to the Diſciples]</hi> by which he diſpatcheth alſo much that Chriſt ſpoke.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To do that more effectually he breaks all in pieces with this reply, <hi>p.</hi> 37. <hi>[it was under the Law before the One offering was actually offered up]</hi> making what Chriſt ſpoke whilſt alive, and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his Prophetick Office to ſignify nothing to us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He makes the Apoſtles to ſpeak by way of condeſcenſion, to take in others and omit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>p.</hi> 77. which though ſometimes uſed, yet muſt not be preſſed, when ſuch terms as we All, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. do include themſelves as well as others.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He declines the Lords Prayer, as taught, <hi>p.</hi> 81. [<hi>when the Diſciples were young and weak,</hi> &amp;c.] which equally deſtroys the whole Sermon on the Mount, at the ſame time delivered. Thus <hi>David George</hi> and the Familiſts ſaid, the Scripture was given to Novices.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He changeth Tenſes, <hi>p.</hi> 137. [is <hi>ſhould be read</hi> was] an alteration, which if allowed, may be ſerviceable to ſtrange purpoſes.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He inlargeth to his party, the particular Promiſes made to the Apoſtles, <hi>p.</hi> 228. and the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44756:110"/> Commands as <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. about meat and drink.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He conceals the unkind parts of a Text, which favour not his Pretenſions, <hi>p.</hi> 230. this he conceals with an <hi>&amp;c. [he ſhall bring to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance all things,</hi> &amp;c.] and quoting, <hi>John,</hi> 16.13. he wholly omitteth the laſt word <hi>[he ſhall ſhew you things to come.]</hi> and yet challengeth all the other Promiſes.</p>
            <p n="11">11. He gives Chriſts words a downright deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>p.</hi> 20. to that Command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.3. to do whatſoever they bid them, he replyes <hi>[nay, hold there, we have had too much of that already.]</hi> He faſtens alſo a Ridiculous Command upon God, whilſt he ſaith <hi>[to challenge a property in mans Labour,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is ridiculous,] p.</hi> 335. when as the Prieſts by Gods Command had a Property therein, receiving the Tenth of that Increaſe obtained by ſweat, care, induſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he ſaith, That [<hi>Chriſts Excellency lay not in Humane Learning,</hi> p. 207.] had he ſaid, His <hi>Commiſſion</hi> lay not there, he had ſpoken like a Schollar of ſo All knowing a Maſter: <hi>He that made the Eye ſhall he not ſee, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe a man be preſſed to any Duty, <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> hath furniſhed him with evaſions, the Law doth not oblige, nor what Chriſt ſpoke before his Death, this diſcards the Old Teſtament and the Goſpel, and the Remainder may be avoided by his Rules, as ſpoke to ſuch as were weak, or under the Law, or by way of Condeſcenſion, or if none cut the knot, yet the laſt breaks the Bonds inſunder. <hi>[Nay hold there, we have had enough of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,]</hi> thus whileſt he is pleading, men may live without Sin, he enervates that Doctrine which was deſigned to keep them from it, and his New Light attempts to turn true Old Religion out of the World.</p>

            <head>The Concluſion.</head>
            <p>HAving Conſidered his Pretence to Inſpirations, I think it not neceſſary now to view his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Humane Learning, that being in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect yielded up, by acknowledging that Learning muſt Tranſlate; put an Engliſh Bible into his hand, for his Spirit, if true, is as able <hi>Immediately</hi> to do the one as the other. When <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> conſiders Sacred Geography, Hiſtoryes, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes, Chronology, the Fabrick of the Temple, the diſperſion of People over the World, Numbers, Weights, Coins, Meaſures, Cuſtoms, Rites, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, with many ſuch, he muſt acknowledg the uſefulneſs of Learning in other concerns, beſides bare tranſlating: the moſt convincing and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Employment for him, will be to let the World ſee the noble Fruits of his <hi>Interpreting Spirit,</hi> for the Miniſtration of the Spirit being given to every one to profit withal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. he is bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the World with his Inſpired Expoſitions, and if he pleaſe as a <hi>Specimen</hi> to begin with the Chronicles, from what he doth perform,<note place="margin">In Prol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>go.</note> we may be induced to change our thoughts about their Pretenſions: St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, the Book of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles is ſuch that without it, <hi>if a man arrogate to himſelf the knowledg of Scriptures, he doth but abuſe and delude himſelf;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> thinks that a cloſe Comment on it, would contribute much Light to the other Scriptures; when we ſee <hi>ſolid Interpretations,</hi> and not <hi>Allegorical Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes</hi> proceed from him, we may entertain better Opinions, but he muſt borrow none of <hi>our Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:44756:111"/> Jewels, nor go to the Philiſtins Forge to ſharpen his Weapons, nor with <hi>David</hi> make uſe of the Sword of <hi>Goliath,</hi> though wrapt in a Cloth behind the Ephod, and that there be none like it.</p>
            <p>For our ſecurity of his Faithful performing, when he diſcerns his Spirit to ſeize on him, let him repair to ſome Juſtice of peace, or his Pariſh-Prieſt, that by them he may be certifyed of the Truth; or, if his Spirit be indiſpoſed, like <hi>Baal,</hi> be talking, purſuing in a Journey, or in a ſleep, and muſt be awaked, we ſhall have patience a while, till he be better fitted, ſuch a <hi>Specimen</hi> (as above) will for a while imploy us; but I ſuppoſe he need no protracting of time, the Spirit of Truth <hi>dwelling</hi> in them, and ſuffering no <hi>receſs,</hi> he muſt be always ready, but if he will bury that his Talent in a nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, and think a rejoynder ſufficient, I deſire he will Demonſtrate the Fruits of the Spirit in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure. The Jews put off difficult things till there ſtood up a Prieſt within <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and afterwards till the coming of <hi>Elias,</hi> if Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers ſpeak true, <hi>better</hi> than <hi>thoſe</hi> are now come among us, 'tis but a Reaſonable Requeſt we make, <hi>viz.</hi> Apoſtolical Proofs, of his Apoſtolical Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or convincing Evidences to remove thoſe many Reaſons drawn up againſt his claims, but he muſt not make out his pretenſions from thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, which he denies to be <hi>the Rule,</hi> and looks upon as unintelligible without Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and when they are produced, do cunclude as fully for any other party as for his; when he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates his Spirit ſome other way, it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve another manner of diſcuſſion; but beſides Miracles, he muſt produce <hi>the Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> or certain proofs like <hi>Daniels</hi> weeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That this is the foretold Seaſon, when the Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
